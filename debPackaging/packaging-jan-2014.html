<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Introduction: the Good Old Days</h1>

<p>Twenty-odd years ago I worked for a company building accounting and stock
control systems for manufacturing businesses. I started as a general gopher,
tea-maker and minor bug fixer on big old behemoths written in a language
called COBOL &mdash; which some people claimed was a &quot;common business-oriented
language&quot; but I was sure stood for &quot;computer operators are boring and
obviously lobotomised&quot;. Customers would phone up and say &quot;we've got a new
invoice format, can you change the report printer to fit?&quot;, and I would spend
a day or two hunched over a stack of continuous paper (the type with
perforated edges) with a special measuring ruler figuring out how many spaces
to leave between the date and the address, and the like.</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bound_computer_printout.agr.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="images/continuous-paper.jpg" alt="Old-style printer paper" width="408" height="599"></a></p>

<p>The low point of this phase was four days of my life spent chasing a rounding
error in an invoicing program that resulted in a 2 pence error on a &pound;10,000
invoice. I told the boss that I was happy to pay them the 2 pence every time
it happenned if only I could stop leafing through that 100-page COBOL
monstrosity<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>, but he didn't
think that was a great customer relations strategy.</p>

<p>The company was starting to move into Unix-based delivery platforms (System V
was the new thing back then; and a whole business would run on a tiny
mini-computer!). I was lucky enough to get my hands dirty with the new
technology, and learnt an awful lot in short space of time. It is a testament
to the power and success of the Unix paradigm that I'm still using many of
these skills today &mdash; C programming, shell scripting, systems administration
and the like.</p>

<p>One of my tasks at the time was to package and distribute versions of our
systems to customer machines. I used a program called UUCP (Unix-to-Unix copy)
over dial-up modem links to push new updates onto machines out on site (and,
cheekily, used to get the customer machine to phone us back so that the
lengthy upload process would happen on their phone bill, not ours!). Things
are a little simpler now: someone invented a thing called the
Internet...<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote2"><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The job of packaging and distribution continues to be important, though, and
below I'll describe the mechanisms used for the Raspberry Pi's <em>Raspbian</em>
operating system. I'll give a couple of downloadable examples, including a
package for <a class="cow-url" href="https://projects.drogon.net/">Gordon Henderson</a>'s excellent
<a class="cow-url" href="http:wiringpi.com">Wiring Pi</a>.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>The Problem</h1>

<p>Software packaging and distribution has to deal with versions, dependencies
and access:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different <em>versions</em> of programs can incorporate lots of changes, including
  critical security fixes that need applying in a hurry. Especially on older
  systems and in low-bandwidth locations, minimising the amount of new
  download for a changed version is important.</li>
<li><em>Dependencies</em> between programs are often tied to particular versions &mdash; if
  a facility that one program relies on changes, the program's package data
  must reflect its need for the old version.</li>
<li><em>Access</em> to packages is relatively easy now &mdash; most software is distributed
  as a network download. But what happens if the connection drops half-way
  through? Or if a million people all want updates on the same day?</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues have been addressed in various ways; one of the most succesful
and wide-reaching is the Debian package management system, and this is the one
that we'll describe here.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>The Platform: GNU, Linux, Debian, Raspbian and Ubuntu</h1>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a <em>distribution</em> of <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a>, which is a Unix-like
operating system (like Android, MacOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and many others).</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/debian-logo-500x242.jpg" alt="Debian" width="500" height="242"></p>

<p>For the Pi there's a special version of Debian called
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a>.</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/raspbian-logo-400x234.jpg" alt="Raspbian" width="400" height="234"></p>

<p>Probably the most popular version of Linux at present is
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, but because of an incompatibility between
the Pi's version of its <a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM
microprocessor</a> and the Ubuntu build system, we can't use Ubuntu's
infrastructure on the Pi, except for programs which are <em>architecture
independent</em> &mdash; a term which we'll explain below when we show how to use
Ubuntu Personal Package Archives for Pi software distribution.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3.1. </span>Ubuntu's Personal Package Archives</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, computer programming languages come in two sorts: <em>compiled</em>
or <em>interpreted</em>. Compiled languages are translated into machine code (binary
instruction sequences) before they can be run. Interpreted languages can be
run directly without any translation. This means that programs written in
interpreted languages are often <em>architecture independent</em> &mdash; they can run
without change on many different types of computer chips. Several languages
popular on the Pi fall into this category, including Shell Script and (with
some restrictions) Python.</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/ubuntu-logo-400x283.png" alt="Ubuntu" width="400" height="283"></p>

<p>As we noted earlier, Ubuntu Linux is very popular (and is also derived from
Debian). Ubuntu has a great set of infrastructure tools associated with it,
including <em>Personal Package Archives</em> (PPAs) which simplify the task of
building, packaging and distributing software for all the platforms supported
by Ubuntu. If we're packaging an architecture-independent program, then, a PPA
can be a good way to distribute it. (Several <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/">Pi GATE</a>
programs are <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/download.html">distributed like
this</a>.)</p>

<p>Linux is <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">open source free
software</a>, and to make sure everyone gets access to the source of programs in
PPAs, Ubuntu only accepts Debian <em>source packages</em> as uploads to the archives.
This means we have to build both a <em>source</em> (<tt>.dsc</tt>) and a <em>binary</em> (<tt>.deb</tt>)
package for each program; the next section describes how we do this.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Debian Packaging</h1>

<p>A lot has been written about packaging, and its fair to say that it isn't the
easiest thing to get started with.<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote3"><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span> We'll take a quick-and-dirty approach here, and give
only enough detail for a couple of simple cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>scripts and other architecture-independent packages (including <em>daemons</em>,
  which are scripts run at system startup)</li>
<li>binaries from compiled languages like C (including shared libraries)</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case the key to the process is to</p>

<ol>
<li>create a <tt>debian</tt> directory in the top-level directory of your software
  tree, containing data to control the package construction process</li>
<li>set up a <tt>Makefile</tt> in the same place which follows certain conventions for
  installation targets</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of this section describes these steps; in <a class="cow-url" href="#case-studies">the next
section</a> we'll give example code.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.1. </span>Creating the <tt>debian</tt> Directory</h2>

<p>The packaging file tree can be seeded using the <tt>dh<span class="cow-escape">_</span>make</tt> program like this:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
   sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper
   dh_make -p=package-name_1.0 --native
</pre>This creates a set of files in the <tt>debian</tt> directory, many of which are
examples or boilerplate which can be ignored. The ones of the set that need
editing in our cases are:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>control</tt>: contains the basic details of the package, its version and
  dependencies</li>
<li><tt>changelog</tt>: describes the changes present in each version</li>
<li><tt>copyright</tt>: describes the licence &mdash; this should be
  <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">an open source licence</a></li>
<li><tt>docs</tt>: lists documentation files, e.g. a <tt>man</tt> page or a <tt>README</tt> for the
  software itself</li>
<li><tt>README</tt>: describes details of the <em>packaging</em> of the software, <em>not</em> the
  software itself</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a file called <tt>rules</tt> which follows Makefile syntax and which
can be used to modify the details of the packaging process. In recent
configurations this file uses a lot of implicit rules and doesn't need any
changes.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.2. </span>Conventions for the <tt>Makefile</tt></h2>

<p>Having created our <tt>debian</tt> file tree we then need to create (or adapt) a
top-level <tt>Makefile</tt> so that it:</p>

<ul>
<li>has a default target (e.g. <tt>all</tt>) which does any necessary compilation and
  linking of the software (for scripts this target probably does nothing)</li>
<li>has an <tt>install</tt> target which adapts to the setting of a <tt>DESTDIR</tt>
  (<em>destination directory</em>) environment variable</li>
</ul>

<p>The second of these is best accomplished using the <tt>install</tt> program. For
example, given a binary called <tt>amazing</tt>, we can install it to <tt>DESTDIR</tt> from
our <tt>Makefile</tt> like this:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-makefile">
  install -d -m 755      $(DESTDIR)/usr/bin
  install -m 755 amazing $(DESTDIR)/usr/bin
</pre>Here the first command makes sure that the target installation directory
(<tt>/usr/bin</tt>) exists; the second copies the binary file and gives it
appropriate permissions for an executable program.</p>

<p>It is also convenient to wrap up the commands relating to packaging in
Makefile targets; the next section describes these commands.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.3."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.3. </span>Creating <tt>.deb</tt> and <tt>.dsc</tt> Files</h2>

<p>As noted earlier, the outputs from the packaging process are files of two
types:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>.deb</tt> files contain binary builds of a program, which is all ready to
  install on a running instance of Raspbian</li>
<li><tt>.dsc</tt> files contain the source code of a program, ready to be built</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll create these files using the <tt>debuild</tt> program. In common with several
other packaging commands, <tt>debuild</tt> uses various helper programs to do its
work. One of the disadvantages of this arrangement is that documentation is
often spread across several locations. For example, the manual for <tt>debuild</tt>
doesn't describe all of the options that it is parameterised by &mdash; some of
them are only described by the helper program documentation. A good place to
start looking for their meaning is in the documentation for
<tt>dpkg-buildpackage</tt> (which in turn calls a whole team of other helpers).</p>

<p>The debuild commands that we need are these:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  debuild -S -Ipackage
  debuild -Ipackage
</pre>The first command builds <em>only</em> a <tt>.dsc</tt> source package (using the <tt>-S</tt>
option). The second builds both a <tt>.dsc</tt> and a <tt>.deb</tt>. In both cases we ignore
the <tt>package</tt> directory (via the <tt>-Ipackage</tt> option) as this is where we'll
put the files generated by <tt>debuild</tt>.</p>

<p>We use the source-only build when we're targetting an Ubuntu PPA (see above)
&mdash; these only accept source packages, building a <tt>.deb</tt> of their own from the
source.</p>

<p>There are a couple more files needed for SimBaMon and BlinkIP that relate to
their role as daemons &mdash; see <tt>postinst</tt>, <tt>postrm</tt> and the <tt>.default</tt> and
<tt>.init</tt> links in
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon/debian">the <tt>debian</tt> directory</a>.</p>

<p>And that's it! With the appropriate Makefile magic, you can now say &quot;<tt>make
package</tt>&quot; and out will pop the files you need to upload to an Ubuntu PPA,
and/or contribute to Raspbian, and/or put on a download page for people to
install themselves.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5.2. </span>WiringPi</h2>

<p>A lot of our recent projects have used the excellent
<a class="cow-url" href="http://wiringpi.com">WiringPi library</a> to
<a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/basics.html#gpio-software">talk to the Pi's electronics</a> from software. A small frustration in this
process has been the library's lack of integration into Raspbian... So I've
written the code needed to do this, and made it available 
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/wiringpi/">from GitHub</a>. It uses a
packaging process exactly like the one described above.</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="images/wiring-pi-bbd.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="images/wiring-pi-bbd-500x295.jpg" alt="A
WiringPi breadboard layout" width="500" height="295"></a></p>

<p>Now we can install WiringPi without having to download or compile it, like
this:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  wget https://raw.github.com/hamishcunningham/wiringpi/master/package/2.13/unstable/wiringpi_2.13_armhf.deb
  sudo dpkg -i ./wiringpi_2.13_armhf.deb
</pre>Unlike the script-based examples in the previous section, WiringPi is written
in the C programming language and therefore needs to be compiled before use.
Gordon Henderson (WiringPi's author) uses a script called <tt>build</tt> to do this;
to create a <tt>.deb</tt> I added a
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/wiringpi/blob/master/Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a> that copies code from the <tt>build</tt> script and adds an <tt>install</tt>
target and packaging targets (like those used in the previous section).</p>

<p>Then I documented the other changes I needed to make (mainly adding the
<tt>debian</tt> directory) and sent the details back to Gordon. Hopefully he'll pull
them into his Git repository one of these days and start the process of
getting WiringPi included in the official Raspbian distribution.</p>

<p>For reference and to give a flavour of the process, below are the details of
the changes made to the library.</p>

<p><hr>
Most of the changes that I needed to make (as opposed to adding new
stuff) are in this commit:
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/wiringpi/commit/707cf1bc343e07c9c07eb67c55ed93873c2c67c8">https://github.com/hamishcunningham/wiringpi/commit/707cf1bc343e07c9c07eb67c55ed93873c2c67c8</a></p>

<p>All the changes needed are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've added a top-level Makefile which does some of
    what the build script does (just building and
    installing the two libraries and the gpio command
    at present). I believe that the build script still
    works as it used to. The package has to be built on the
    Pi itself; I tried cross-compiling but didn't get far :-(</li>
<li>In the library Makefiles this line assumes that the
    binary has been written into DESTDIR, without PREFIX:
        <tt>@ln -sf $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)/lib/libwiringPiDev.so.$(VERSION) $(DESTDIR)/lib/libwiringPiDev.so</tt>.
    This doesn't seem to be the case, however... so I've added
    a PREFIX. Perhaps I've missed something about how make
    should be invoked, or...?</li>
<li>The package build process requires that DESTDIR is
    used for everything &mdash; so calling &quot;ldconfig&quot; without
    parameterising it for DESTDIR causes an error. I've
    changed it to use DESTDIR for now, and also called
    ldconfig in the .deb's postinst and postrm scripts.
    This broke the build script's install, so I added this
    hack to the library Makefiles:
      <tt>@if [ x$(DESTDIR) = x/usr ]; then ldconfig; fi</tt></li>
<li>The devLib/Makefile does a -I., but this doesn't
    pick up the headers in DESTDIR, so I've changed INCLUDE
    there to do so (in the same way the gpio/Makefile does).</li>
<li>The gpio build needs the core library to be built
    first, so I've put both the bare &quot;make&quot; and the &quot;make
    install&quot; under the top-level &quot;install&quot; target.
    Probably non-optimal.</li>
<li>I have changed the gpio install to use the &quot;install&quot;
    command, which doesn't assume that the process is
    running as root.</li>
<li>The .deb installs into /usr instead of /usr/local; I
    believe that Debian mandates that the latter is
    reserved for a &quot;local administrator&quot; or similar. The
    examples builds still work without change to the -I
    or -L flags as /usr is included in the default paths,
    it seems.</li>
<li>I have added a compressed version of the man page,
    as that seems to be expected. I've also made it install
    the man page in /usr/share as that's the normal place
    on Debian. That might want parameterising in &quot;build&quot;
    if you want it to target other operating systems. Doing
    &quot;man gpio&quot; works but complains about lacking the .1 file;
    no idea why :-(</li>
<li>I added an &quot;install from .deb&quot; para to the INSTALL file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here endeth the lesson. Debian packaging is a bit of a black art, but with a
little effort (and a lot of copying from our elders and betters!) the results
are very powerful, stable and long-lasting solutions to the problems of
software distribution and installation. Now it's your turn ;-)</p>

<span class="cow-footnote-text" name="footnote1">The program is engraved on my soul &mdash; it was called
SOP-1, for Sales Order Processing, and it had grown and grown far beyond the
ability of a neophyte like myself to ever understand. Trial and error was my
only weapon, and it was a definite trial with lots of errors.</span>

<span class="cow-footnote-text" name="footnote2">The Internet, of course, mostly runs on Unix-based
operating systems, as does your Pi, Android phones, and Apple computers.</span>

<a class="cow-footnote-anchor" name="footnote3"></a>
<span class="cow-footnote-text" name="footnote3">There are several reasons why
packaging is hard. Debian is a distribution of code largely produced by other
projects, so the packaging documentation often assumes that we're starting
from someone else's systems, whereas in our case that's not true. Its design
also dates back to a time where disk space and network bandwidth were very
limited and it was important to split systems down into very small chunks
stored on different disk partitions, problems that are less acute today.
Nevertheless the original designers did such a good job that it's still the
best there is. Kudos.</span>
