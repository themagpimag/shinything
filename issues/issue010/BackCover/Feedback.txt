I am new to RPi.  It is great.  Thanks for your mag.  I download it and then transfer to my Kindle where it is easy to read.

Thanks you for the great project regarding the pi magazine. When I was a child my father used to buy these kind of magazines and I miss them, not only for me, but for the new children who think the only OS in existence is that thing called windows, and when they look at linux just don't know what to do, even when they are computer related students. Don't ask when they are confronted with the command line.

I’m a big fan of the raspberry and also appreciate all the work you put in the MagPi magazine. It’s a pleasure to read the articles and feel the energy and love your team of volunteers put into that.
Thank you very much

I have read your current issues of the mag and am delighted with it. It has been a while since this sort of publication was available, and I have been wanting to get into programming for years, even up to the point of attending college. But with this I can study at my own pace and start my own projects. I dont have a pie as of yet, but intend to buy the starter pack from Maplin as soon as I can. Again, thanks.

I was wondering if I could write for The Mag Pi magazine, I love the
magazine, and I of course love technology and writing. I was also one
of the first Raspberry Pi users. Thank you.

I just wanted you to know that I love your magazine. It is well laid out and highly informative. It is the perfect introduction for students, and also hobbyists to the wonderful world of Raspberry Pi. Believe me when I say, you are helping create the next generation of Engineers, makers, hackers, and artists. Keep up the great work.
